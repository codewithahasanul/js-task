// Task-1
// You went to the supermarket to buy some oranges and apples. Calculate how much money the shopkeeper will return.

let totalTaka = 1000;
let orangePrice = 350; // Price/kg
let applePrice = 350; // Price/kg

let totalCost = orangePrice + applePrice;
let changeMoney = totalTaka - totalCost;
console.log("Shopkeeper will return:", changeMoney);
